    <h1>Privacy Policy for MyQA</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 6/10/2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how MyQA ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our label verification application ("the App").</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Our app collects the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera Data:</strong> We require camera access to scan and verify product labels. Images are processed on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Label Information:</strong> We collect and store information from scanned labels including APN numbers, dates, and weights.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Basic device information required for app functionality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Verifying product labels</li>
        <li>Generating verification reports</li>
        <li>Creating CSV exports of verified items</li>
        <li>Improving app functionality</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>All data is stored locally on your device. We do not transmit or store your data on external servers. CSV exports are controlled entirely by you.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share your data with third parties. Any data export (such as CSV files) is initiated and controlled by you.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access your data through the app's interface</li>
        <li>Export your data in CSV format</li>
        <li>Delete your data using the app's clear function</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Camera Usage</h2>
    <p>Our app requires camera access to function. We use the camera only for scanning product labels. Camera data is processed in real-time and is not stored unless you explicitly save a verification result.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
